This repository features the code and data of the projects with a quantitative analysis. The `acceptability study` presents results on acceptability ratings of pronominal and active constructions for psych verbs in Catalan and Spanish. The `scetch study` presents results from prompt written elicitation of psych verbs in Catalan and Spanish. An abstract, slides and more information can be found in the README of the respective folders.
Each of the folders contains a `code` and a `data` folder containing the respective files for the project. 
> There is a HTML file of the analysis to facilitate reading. 

## Getting the code and data

# About the project
In May 2023 a group of students from the Romance and the Linguistics department had the opportunity to conduct field work Mallorca concerning psych-predicates in Romance Languages (Focus on Spanish and Catalan). The trip was funded by DAAD Hochschuldialog mit Südeuropa 2023 and is a cooperation between the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf and the University of the Balearic Islands. Across all sub-projects the students conducted filedwork concerning several research questions: 
- To which extent do we find variation in Balear Catalan?
  - Do Balear Catalan differ from Standard Catalan?
  - Is there an influence of Spanish on Balear Catalan?
  - What is the role of attitudes concerning the Catalan of Barcelona?
- Polycentric Variation of Spanish?
  - Are the islands a centre of Spanish that differs from Standard European Spanish?
  - Differences according to the origin of the informant (Peninsular, LA, Local)?
- How to deal with intrasystematic variation?
  - What are the factors (Causativity, Stativity, etc.)?
  - Theoretical considerations, formal descriptions?

## Acknowledgments
