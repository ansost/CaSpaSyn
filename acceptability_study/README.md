**Abstract:**

As noted by many linguists, object experiencer verbs (OE-verbs) in DAT constructions are systematically stative, whereas those appearing in ACC constructions are to some degree associated with an agentive interpretation of the subject (Marín & McNally, 2011:468). OE-verbs in reflexive constructions, however, are said to be carrying a notion of dynamicity (Fábregas & Marín, 2020:221). In Spanish, object experiencer verbs may appear in all three constructions (DAT, AKK, REFL), however it is unclear whether these constructions carry the same acceptance in Catalan (Royo 2020, 2021), a language that is oftentimes regarded as rather similar to Spanish due to their geographical and cultural proximity. Recent research has also shown that subject animacy effects can influence the acceptability of zero-state readings (Fritz-Huechante, Verhoeven & Rott, 2020). In our talk, we present results from an acceptability study on active vs. pronominal, as well as animate vs. inanimate acceptability ratings for object-experience psych verbs in Catalan and Spanish. In particular, we focus on two research questions: 1. How do the acceptability ratings differ in Catalan and Spanish utterances containing an object experiencer verb?, and 2. To what extend does stimuli animacy influence the voice acceptability of Catalan utterances containing an object experiencer verb? Our results may help understand some of the fundamental linguistic differences between Spanish and Catalan in the realm of OE-verbs, as well as provide first insights into stimulus animacy influence in Catalan specifically.
