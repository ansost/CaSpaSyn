# Sketch-based elicitation of psych verbs in Spanish and Catalan on Mallorca

This study, i.e., the ‘sketch study’, aims to elucidate my annotation methods and selected initial insights.

**Methods** This study incorporates elicitation methodology to investigate how four verbs in Spanish and Catalan are used upon being promted with a simple sketch description task. The stimuli comprised of four sketched scenes, each labeled with one of the four target verbs (*molestar*(*se*) / *molestar*(-*se*) ’to annoy’, *entristecer*(*se*) / *entristir*(-*se*) ’to sadden’, *enfadar*(*se*) /*enfadar*(-*se*) ’to anger’ and *alegrar*(*se*) / *alegrar*(-*se*) ’to gladden’). Participants were tasked to describe the scene in writing, incorporating the target verb into their description.

**Data and annotations** Test subjects freely selected one of the two language options of this study, resulting in more Catalan participants (n = 64) than Spanish participants (n = 15). The total of 79 participants over four verbs generated 316 sketch descriptions. These descriptions then
underwent annotation, in which I coded for six syntactic properties, which are visualized in this project: voice of the predicate, the order of experiencer and verb, the construction of the stimulus argument, the syntactic function of the target, the verbal tense of the target, and the noting of any preposition used. This process resulted in a total of 1830 data points, as 11 descriptions could not be used due to lacking target verbs.

**Initial insights and next steps** The project also provides primary findings regarding the six annotated parameters, addressing the questions: Where do the four verbs demonstrate similar or differing patterns within a language? Do these verb-specific patterns parallel one another when comparing both languages? The chief focus here lies on a quantitative look at the parameters of voice and stimulus argument constructions.
